### üïπÔ∏è Game Flow Overview

1. **Role Assignment**
   - System randomly assigns roles at game start.  
   - Private role screen shown to each player.  
   - Visibility logic:
     - Merlin sees all Evil players.
     - Percival sees Merlin + Morgana (cannot distinguish them).
     - Evil players see each other.

2. **Leader Rotation**
   - Round 1: Leader chosen randomly.  
   - Each round, leadership rotates clockwise.  
   - The leader selects team members for the mission.

3. **Discussion Phase**
   - After team proposal, players discuss the proposed team one by one in turn order.
   - Each player gets a chance to voice their opinion about the proposed team.
   - Leader makes a final summary statement to confirm the final team composition.
   - Discussion helps players gather information and make informed voting decisions.
   - **Exception**: On the 5th consecutive vote (after 4 rejections), discussion phase is skipped.

4. **Team Voting**
   - All players vote **Approve** or **Reject** the proposed team.
   - If majority approves ‚Üí proceed to mission.
   - If rejected ‚Üí leadership passes to the next player.
   - **Special Rule**: On the 5th consecutive vote, the team is automatically approved without voting (forced mission).
   - If 5 votes are needed (after 4 rejections + 5th forced mission), the mission proceeds automatically.

5. **Mission Phase**
   - Selected members secretly choose **Success** or **Fail**.  
   - Good must always choose Success; Evil can choose either.  
   - If any Fail card is played, the mission fails.

6. **Win Conditions**
   - **Good wins** after 3 successful missions ‚Üí Assassin may attempt to kill Merlin.  
   - If Assassin kills the correct player ‚Üí **Evil wins**.  
   - If Assassin kills wrong ‚Üí **Good wins**.  
   - **Evil wins** immediately after 3 failed missions.
