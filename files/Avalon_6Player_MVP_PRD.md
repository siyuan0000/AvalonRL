# 🧙‍♀️ Avalon (6-Player) MVP Product Requirement Document

## 1. Product Overview

Avalon is a social deduction game of hidden roles and trust.  
In the MVP version, we aim to create a **minimal yet complete digital version** of the 6-player Avalon setup, optimized for quick setup, smooth gameplay, and clarity of information.  
The game logic, voting system, and mission structure follow the official Avalon rules, adapted for a 6-player configuration.

- Enable smooth play in both **online** and **local** (pass-and-play) modes.

### 🧑‍💻 Target Users

## 3. Game Rules (6-Player Configuration)

### 🧩 Role Composition

| Faction | Role | Count | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| Good | Merlin | 1 | Knows all Evil players (except Mordred, not in this setup) |
| Good | Percival | 1 | Sees Merlin & Morgana as “two possible Merlins” |
| Good | Loyal Servants of Arthur | 2 | No special abilities |
| Evil | Morgana | 1 | Appears as Merlin to Percival |
| Evil | Assassin | 1 | Knows other Evil and kills Merlin if Evil loses |

**Total: 6 Players (4 Good, 2 Evil)**

---

### 🕹️ Game Flow Overview

1. **Role Assignment**
   - System randomly assigns roles at game start.  
   - Private role screen shown to each player.  
   - Visibility logic:
     - Merlin sees all Evil players.
     - Percival sees Merlin + Morgana (cannot distinguish them).
     - Evil players see each other.

2. **Leader Rotation**
   - Round 1: Leader chosen randomly.  
   - Each round, leadership rotates clockwise.  
   - The leader selects team members for the mission.

3. **Team Voting**
   - All players vote **Approve** or **Reject** the proposed team.  
   - If majority approves → proceed to mission.  
   - If rejected → leadership passes to the next player.  
   - Five consecutive rejections = automatic Evil win.

4. **Mission Phase**
   - Selected members secretly choose **Success** or **Fail**.  
   - Good must always choose Success; Evil can choose either.  
   - If any Fail card is played, the mission fails.

5. **Win Conditions**
   - **Good wins** after 3 successful missions → Assassin may attempt to kill Merlin.  
   - If Assassin kills the correct player → **Evil wins**.  
   - If Assassin kills wrong → **Good wins**.  
   - **Evil wins** immediately after 3 failed missions.

   - Room code displayed clearly  

2. **Role Reveal Screen**

4. **Voting Screen**  
   - Approve (✅) / Reject (❌) buttons  
   - Animated vote results reveal  

5. **Mission Screen**  
   - Selected players choose Success / Fail card  
   - Reveal after all have submitted  

6. **Result Summary Screen**  
   - Progress tracker (5 circles: success/fail)  
   - “Next Round” button  

7. **Final Assassination Screen**
